# CryptoClustering
## Overview
Objective: The goal of this project is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies and analyze whether they are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. This challenge focuses on using Python and the K-means clustering algorithm to explore patterns in cryptocurrency data.

## Background
Cryptocurrencies have seen tremendous growth and volatility, making them an interesting subject for analysis. The objective is to use clustering techniques to see if cryptocurrencies can be grouped based on their short-term (24-hour) and medium-term (7-day) price changes.

## Getting Started

## Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoClustering.git
cd CryptoClustering
Install Required Dependencies:
Make sure to install all necessary Python libraries before starting the analysis. This project mainly uses pandas, scikit-learn, and hvPlot.

## Usage
Run the Analysis:
Open the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb notebook and run each cell sequentially. The notebook is designed to guide you through the data loading, preparation, analysis, and visualization steps.

## Explore Results:
The notebook will generate several plots to help visualize the clustering results. Use these plots to draw conclusions about how cryptocurrencies are affected by price changes.
